💡 TRAINING TIPS

1. Start with simple data (sine wave)
2. Use medium parameters initially
3. Train for at least 50 epochs
4. Watch loss decrease steadily
5. If loss increases, reduce learning rate
6. If training is too slow, increase learning rate
7. More hidden units = more capacity but slower
8. Add noise to improve generalization

📈 INTERPRETING RESULTS

LOSS PLOT:
  • Should decrease over time
  • Log scale shows relative improvements
  • Plateaus indicate convergence
  • Spikes may indicate learning issues

PREDICTION PLOT:
  • Blue line = Actual data
  • Red dashed = Model predictions
  • Closer alignment = better performance
  • Check both trends and details

MSE (Mean Squared Error):
  • Lower is better
  • < 0.01: Excellent
  • 0.01-0.1: Good
  • 0.1-1.0: Fair
  • > 1.0: Poor (needs more training or parameter tuning)

⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

PROBLEM: Loss not decreasing

🔮 FUTURE PREDICTION GUIDE [NEW!]

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. Load custom CSV data (or use generated data)
  2. Model uses last 'sequence_length' values as seed
  3. Predicts next N values step by step
  4. Each prediction becomes input for next step

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
  Step 1: Prepare CSV with 30 temperature values
  Step 2: Train model with similar pattern (sine wave)
  Step 3: Load CSV with "Load CSV Data"
  Step 4: Click "Predict Future Values"
  Step 5: Enter 7 (predict next week)
  Step 6: View predictions on graph

CSV FORMAT:
  Temperature
  15.2
  16.8
  18.5
  ...
  
  Rules:
  • First row = header (optional, will be skipped)
  • One number per row
  • Minimum 10 values
  • Comma or dot decimal separator

TIPS:
  • More historical data = better predictions
  • Train with similar pattern types
  • Short-term predictions (5-10 steps) are more accurate
  • Long-term predictions (100+ steps) accumulate error

📚 TECHNICAL DETAILS

The RNN uses:
  • Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
  • Gradient clipping (prevents exploding gradients)
  • Xavier weight initialization
  • Mean squared error loss
  • Gradient descent optimization
  • Inverted Dropout for regularization [NEW!]

Formula:
  h_t = activation(W_xh * x_t + W_hh * h_{t-1} + b_h)
  
  [With Dropout during training]:
  h_t = h_t * dropout_mask / (1 - dropout_rate)
  
  y_t = W_hy * h_t + b_y

Dropout Mechanism:
  • Training: Random units dropped with probability p
  • Inference: All units active, no scaling needed
  • Prevents co-adaptation of neurons
  • Improves generalization

💾 FILE FORMATS

Models are saved as:
  • .pkl: Model weights and parameters (includes dropout_rate)
  • _config.json: Data normalization info

CSV files:
  • .csv or .txt: Time series data
  • One value per line
  • First line can be header

Both files needed for complete model restoration.
